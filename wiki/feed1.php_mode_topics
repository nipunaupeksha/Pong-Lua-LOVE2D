Hi, I'm writing some collision code that I can't seem to get working the way I want. Here are the steps I'm taking to try to resolve collisions between a player moved by the arrow keys and a static box:<br /><br />Step 1: move player in response to key presses<br /><br />Step 2: check if the player's bounding box intersects with the box's bounding box, if so continue to step 3, otherwise back to step 1<br /><br />Step 3: check if the player collided with the box along the x axis, if so move the player to his previous x position (before the collision happened) and continue to step 4, otherwise go to step 5<br /><br />Step 4: check if the player collided with the box along the y axis, if so move the player to his previous y position, then go back to step 1<br /><br />Step 5: the player must have only collided along the y axis, so move the player to his previous y position, and leave his x position as-is<br /><br />So far the code mostly works, it resolves the collision nicely if the player is only moving in one direction (either at the box or along it), but if you try to move into the box diagonally the player stops in a jarring way. I'd like to be able to slide along the box while holding two keys. I've used Kikito's Bump library before and it handled the sliding behavior very well, but his code is slightly above my understanding so if I can code my own collision functions from scratch in a more simple way (even with outside help) that would be preferable.<br /><br />Any help you guys are able to provide would be great.<dl class="file"><dt><img src="./images/upload_icons/love.png" alt="" /> <a class="postlink" href="https://love2d.org/forums/download/file.php?id=12974&amp;sid=5bbd1131a2eabefa84b3ae797750f6e0">collision.love</a></dt></dl><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=137564">monkeyman</a> — Fri Apr 01, 2016 7:41 am — Replies 2 — Views 81</p><hr />

Hello! I've been working in LÖVE for a long time, but I've released so few projects. The other ones were either not as good as I expected, or I lost motivation to work on them. Here I'd like to occasionally post some of these unreleased projects. Perhaps you can learn from them or be inspired. (Or maybe you will understand why they weren't released before  <img class="smilies" src="https://love2d.org/forums/images/smilies/ms-death.png" alt=":death:" title="Death" />)<br /><br />If you are motivated, please post your own unfinished projects! We can all learn together!<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">Fabled Blade</span></span><br />Created by Ikroth and Nuthen<br />Worked on from April 2014 - July 2014<br /><br /><strong>Things I like about it:</strong><br />- The node generation in the overworld<br />- The frame border around different things<br />- The nice pieces of art<br />- Fun combat - The animations and effects keep it engaging<br />- Animation on the battle victory screen<br /><br /><strong>Things I don't like about it:</strong><br />- Inconsistent art. Most of the art was found online.<br />- Boring overworld. You spend a lot of time on it, but it's just a few boring colors and flat surfaces.<br />- Too many underdeveloped systems (event, item, dialogue). I tried to make everything as extensive as possible, but I was too overambitious for what I was able to do at the time.<br /><br /><strong>What I can learn from it:</strong><br />- Focus on one thing at a time.<br />- Don't worry about having every feature. Do a few features well.<br /><br />Warning, the code is messy, and many things don't work. Today I would code it much differently. It is very playable though!<br /><br /><strong>Things to know when you play:</strong><br />- It's designed to work without a mouse. All of the navigation is done with arrow keys and enter/x to select.<br />- The goal of each area is to reach the purple node. That takes you to the next area.<br />- The blue nodes are towns.<br />- When walking onto a red node, there is a chance to enter battle with 1-3 enemies<br /><br /><img src="https://giant.gfycat.com/OccasionalUnnaturalDairycow.gif" class="postimage" alt="Image" /><dl class="file"><dt><img src="./images/upload_icons/love.png" alt="" /> <a class="postlink" href="https://love2d.org/forums/download/file.php?id=12970&amp;sid=5bbd1131a2eabefa84b3ae797750f6e0">Fabled Blade.love</a></dt></dl><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=128603">Nuthen224</a> — Thu Mar 31, 2016 8:59 pm — Replies 0 — Views 94</p><hr />

I've been making a few changes to a <a href="https://github.com/airstruck/knife/blob/master/knife/chain.lua" class="postlink">module</a> containing a small utility function. The function is fairly simple, and the behavior is fairly straightforward. I'm having a hard time with the <a href="https://github.com/airstruck/knife/blob/master/readme/chain.md" class="postlink">documentation</a>, though. I'm never quite sure how to handle formal documentation for anything that doesn't line up neatly with procedural or OO paradigms.<br /><br />In particular, the function exposed by the module takes user-defined functions as its parameters, it passes generated functions into those UDFs to be invoked by the user, and returns yet another function. There are a lot of anonymous functions to document, basically. Actual use is very simple, but the documentation makes it look complicated.<br /><br />Does anyone have any tips on how to write decent documentation for this kind of thing?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=136704">airstruck</a> — Thu Mar 31, 2016 7:44 pm — Replies 5 — Views 232</p><hr />
